            <h2>About My Sports Career</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am Ashok Chacko and this is a quick brief on my sports career. The first sport I played was Ice Hockey in the 6th grade. It was my first real experience with sports. Playing sports from an early age helped me learn integral teamwork skills and social skills that a lot of on paper intelligent people tend to lack. I spent a lot of my middle school years getting in shape and working out. It paid off because I was able to join the football team for my first year of high school and score multiple touchdowns despite not knowing how to play football when I first joined the team. After football I joined wrestling to imporve my football skills. I quickly fell in love with wrestling and made it my main focus of my spots career. I ended my freshman season with placing 3rd at the Chicago Catholic League championships. This was a very impressive mark but it gave me motivation to train harder because I was only one match away from winning it all. During Spring I joined the track and field team to just keep up with my physicallity during the off-season. Sophmore year I played another season of football and continued my success from my freshman season. I am currently in my wrestling season and I have goals for winning the CCL tournament and making a run to state. My current record is 9-2</p>

          <h2>My Strengths (Literally)</h2>
          <p>I have been working out for a quite a while so it makes sense that I have come to see some of the fruits of my labor. My main focus has always been being really strong for my body weight, That is why I started with calithenics where I can do cool moves like the Iron Cross, Front Lever, Handstand Push Ups, and mor, but I also am very strong when it comes to the traditional gym workouts. I have the strongest body weight lifts in the class of 2026 in my school by a signficant margin and These are my current numbers for the big 3 lifts. <br> Bench - 240 <br> Squat - 325 <br> Deadlift 405 <br> Bodyweight - 150 <br> To the right is me hitting my bench PR in a UChicago T-shirt</p>
