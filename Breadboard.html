            <h2>My Circuits</h2>
            <p>Before I talk about my circuits, I highly recommend you see them for yourself. Click on this link to see my youtube channel or scroll to the bottom of the page to see my social medias. (https://bit.ly/3O2hGtE). Ben Eater was the reason I got into circuits and breadboard. I once saw a YouTube video from his channel and I was immedietally hooked. A large focus of Ben Eater's channel is creating a various computaional modules out of only breadboards. His videos convinced me to buy a breadboard, arduino, and some parts. My first couple projects was exploring how logic gates work and how simple logic could be used to perform mathematical operations. My first major project was to create a transistor based binary adding machine. This project taught me a lot about how logic gates can be stacked upon each other to perform greater functions. My project in particular utilized only NOR gates to make 4 full adders that could be used to add numbers up to 5 bits. Using 2's compliment you can also use my adding machine to subtract numbers. For all of my circuitry projects all of the wiring and schematics were brainstormed by myself without much assitance from the internet.</p>

          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>After creating my basic arithmetic machine I started to think about my next project. I decided that in suit of learning how computers worked, I would try to make working computer memory. I did some research on different types of latches and flip flops and eventually decided to make a D latch register to store the outputs from the adding and subtracting module. My next project was creating an arduino based console. It was capable of playing multiple games like Snake, Dino and games that games that I designed myself. I also made a device that would wirelessly turn on and off my light switch from the comfort of my desk saving me the ardous trek of walking to the light switch myself</p>
